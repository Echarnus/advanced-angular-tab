## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Enterprise applications need sophisticated data tables that can handle large datasets while maintaining excellent UX through features like sticky headers, frozen columns, and expandable detail views.

**User Context**: Data analysts, administrators, and business users need to efficiently browse, sort, and examine detailed information within large datasets.

**Critical Path**: Data loading → Visual scanning → Sorting/filtering → Row expansion for details → Action execution

**Key Moments**: 
1. Initial data presentation with clear visual hierarchy
2. Smooth scrolling experience with persistent navigation elements
3. Instant feedback on interactions (sorting, expanding, pagination)

## Essential Features

### ✅ Implemented Core Features

   - **Expand column always frozen** (latest update)
   - Seamless integration within single table element
   - Automatic width calculation and positioning

3. **Expandable Rows**
   - **Always frozen expand column** for consistent access
   - Custom template support for detailed views
   - Toggle between manual button clicks and row click expansion
   - Rich detail presentation with cards and action buttons

4. **Advanced Sorting**
   - Visual sort indicators with direction arrows
   - Event-driven architecture for parent component handling
   - Tri-state sorting (asc/desc/none)
   - Multiple column sorting capability

5. **Configurable Pagination**
   - Customizable page sizes
   - Optional pagination display
   - Comprehensive pagination controls
   - Total count and range display

6. **Theme Support**
   - Light/dark mode with theme switcher
   - Consistent color scheme across all table elements
   - Professional blue color palette
   - Proper contrast ratios for accessibility

7. **Column Width Management**
   - **Optional width definitions** - columns without width take available space
   - **Min/max width constraints** for flexible column sizing
   - Fixed width columns for consistent presentation (badges, actions)
   - Ellipsis overflow handling with tooltips
   - Multiline text support option
   - Auto vs fixed table layout based on column configuration
   - Smart frozen column positioning with flexible widths

8. **Responsive Scrolling**
   - Horizontal scroll for wide tables
   - **Removed height constraints** to prevent double scrollbars
   - Smooth scrolling experience
   - Container-aware height management

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity

**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with modern sophistication
**Design Personality**: Clean, data-focused, enterprise-grade
**Visual Metaphors**: Spreadsheet familiarity with enhanced digital capabilities
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes data clarity

### Color Strategy

**Color Scheme Type**: Professional blue monochromatic with accent colors
**Primary Color**: `oklch(0.55 0.15 240)` - Professional blue for actions and focus
**Secondary Colors**: Subtle grays for backgrounds and borders
**Accent Color**: `oklch(0.6 0.15 140)` - Green for success states
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and professionalism, essential for data-heavy interfaces

### Typography System

**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter font family for optimal screen readability
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, data, and metadata
**Font Personality**: Modern, neutral, highly legible
**Readability Focus**: Optimized for data scanning and comparison

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

**Attention Direction**: Header → Frozen columns → Data content → Actions
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding for data breathing room
**Grid System**: Table-based layout with consistent alignment
**Responsive Approach**: Horizontal scrolling for data integrity

### UI Elements & Component Selection

**Component Usage**: 
- Shadcn UI components for consistency
- Custom table implementation for advanced features
- Cards for detailed views
- Badges for status indicators

**Component States**: Comprehensive hover, active, and focus states
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for clear action representation
**Spacing System**: Consistent 4px grid system

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Designed for large datasets with efficient rendering
**Testing Focus**: Scroll performance, sticky behavior, and responsive design
**Critical Questions**: Performance with very large datasets, accessibility compliance

## Latest Updates

### ✅ Expand Column Always Frozen
- Expand column now maintains frozen position at left edge
- Consistent styling with `sticky left-0 z-10 bg-card`
- Proper z-index layering with other frozen elements
- Supports both manual button clicks and row click expansion modes
- Visual indicators adapt to interaction mode

### ✅ Flexible Column Width System
- Optional width definitions for columns
- Columns without specified widths automatically take remaining space
- Maintains proportional distribution among flexible columns
- Smart table layout switching (auto vs fixed based on configuration)
- Preserves frozen column positioning with both fixed and flexible widths

### Column Width Configuration System

**Width Type Options**:
1. **Fixed Width** (`width: 120`): Absolute pixel width for consistent sizing
2. **Min/Max Width** (`minWidth: 100, maxWidth: 300`): Flexible sizing within constraints
3. **No Width Constraints**: Flexible columns that share available space
4. **Mixed Configuration**: Combination of fixed and flexible columns

**Best Practices**:
- Use fixed widths for UI elements (badges, buttons, icons)
- Use min/max for content that varies in length (names, descriptions)
- Leave no constraints for flexible content areas
- Smart table layout switching (auto vs fixed based on configuration)
- Preserves frozen column positioning with both fixed and flexible widths

### ✅ Removed Height Constraints
- Eliminated fixed table height to prevent double scrollbars
- Table now adapts to parent container height
- Improved scrolling experience
- Better integration with page layouts

### Theme Integration
- Comprehensive light/dark mode support
- Consistent color variables across all table elements
- Professional blue color scheme
- Proper backdrop blur effects for modern aesthetic

## Reflection

This implementation uniquely combines enterprise-grade functionality with modern design principles. The always-frozen expand column ensures users never lose access to detailed information while navigating large datasets. The event-driven architecture maintains clean separation of concerns while providing comprehensive interaction capabilities.

The solution excels through attention to micro-interactions, consistent design language, and performance optimization for real-world data usage scenarios.
