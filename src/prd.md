   - Smooth scrolling experience
   - Container-aware height management

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity

**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with modern sophistication
**Design Personality**: Clean, data-focused, enterprise-grade
**Visual Metaphors**: Spreadsheet familiarity with enhanced digital capabilities
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes data clarity

### Color Strategy

**Color Scheme Type**: Professional blue monochromatic with accent colors
**Primary Color**: `oklch(0.55 0.15 240)` - Professional blue for actions and focus
**Secondary Colors**: Subtle grays for backgrounds and borders
**Accent Color**: `oklch(0.6 0.15 140)` - Green for success states
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and professionalism, essential for data-heavy interfaces

### Typography System

**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter font family for optimal screen readability
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, data, and metadata
**Font Personality**: Modern, neutral, highly legible
**Readability Focus**: Optimized for data scanning and comparison

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

**Attention Direction**: Header → Frozen columns → Data content → Actions
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding for data breathing room
**Grid System**: Table-based layout with consistent alignment
**Responsive Approach**: Horizontal scrolling for data integrity

### UI Elements & Component Selection

**Component Usage**: 
- Shadcn UI components for consistency
- Custom table implementation for advanced features
- Cards for detailed views
- Badges for status indicators

**Component States**: Comprehensive hover, active, and focus states
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for clear action representation
**Spacing System**: Consistent 4px grid system

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Designed for large datasets with efficient rendering
**Testing Focus**: Scroll performance, sticky behavior, and responsive design
**Critical Questions**: Performance with very large datasets, accessibility compliance
